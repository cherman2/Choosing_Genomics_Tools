## Comparison of DNA methods

There are three general methods we will discuss for evaluating DNA sequences. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) assays more of the genome than other methods but is much more costly and computationally intensive. Depending on your goals WGS may be overkill. SNP microarrays on the other hand, are much more cost effective but are not able to be used for exploratory purposes. Whole Exome Sequencing (WXS or WES) and other targeted sequencing methods allow you to survey regions of the genome in way that is more cost effective and potentially at higher depths.

In these upcoming chapters we will discuss in more detail each of these methods, what the data represent, what you need to consider, and what resources you can consult for analyzing your data.
