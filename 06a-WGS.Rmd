## Benefits of WGS 

```{r, fig.alt = "Benefits of WGS: 
Most complete account of individual variation 
Ability to study: 
Structural rearrangements
Copy number variations
Insertion-Deletions
SNPs
Sequencing repeats 
Coding, non-coding, and mitochondrial genome coverage 
WGS compared to WES: 
limited vs entire genome
targeted view of protein-coding regions
WGS allows for discovery - identify causative variants

## Comparing WGS to other modalities 

```{r, fig.alt = "Comparing WGS to other sequencing modalities 
The most common DNA sequencing techniques are described. Whole genome sequencing coverages all genes and non-coding DNA. 3.2 billion bases are covered when applied to human samples. This the most expensive of the techniques. Depth of coverage required for 99.9% sensitivity is 30X. 
Whole exome sequencing coverage is the exome or expressed genes. Approximately 45 million bases are sequenced. This is a cost-effective technique. The depth of coverage required for 99.9% sensitivity is 100X. Targeted gene panel sequencing coverages 50-500 genes. 20,000 to 62 million bases are sequenced. This is the most cost-effective technique. Depth of coverage is >500X. ", out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
