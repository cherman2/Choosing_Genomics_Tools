## Learning Objectives

```

In this chapter we are going to cover sequencing and microarray workflows at a very general high level overview to give you a first orientation. As we dive into specific data types and experiments, we will get into more specifics.
Here we will cover the most common file formats. If you have a file format you are dealing with that you don't see listed here, it may be specific to your data type and we will discuss that more in that data type's respective chapter. We still suggest you go through this chapter to give you a basic understanding of commonalities of all genomic data types and workflows

### What do genomics workflows look like?

In the most general sense, all genomics data when originally collected is raw, it needs to undergo processing to be normalized and ready to use. Then normalized data is generally summarized in a way that is ready for it to be further consumed. Lastly, this summarized data is what can be used to make inferences and create plots and results tables.

```

### Basic file formats

Before we get into bioinformatic file types, we should establish some general file types that you likely have already worked with on your computer. These file types are used in all kinds of applications and not specific to bioinformatics.

#### TXT - Text

A text file is a very basic file format that contains text!

#### TSV - Tab Separated Values

Tab separated values file is a text file is good for storing a data table.
It has rows and columns where each value is separated by (you guessed it), _tabs_.
Most commonly, if your genomics data has been provided to you in a TSV or CSV file, it has been processed and summarized! It will be your job to know _how_ it was processed and summarized

Here the literal `⇥` represents tabs which often may show up invisible in your text editor's preference settings.
```
gene_id⇥sample_1⇥sample_2
gene_a⇥12⇥15,
gene_b⇥13⇥14
```

#### CSV - Comma Separated Values

A comma separated values file is list just like a TSV file but instead of values being separated by tabs it is separated by... (you guessed it), _commas_!

In its raw form, a CSV file might look like our example below (but if you open it with a program for spreadsheets, like Excel or Googlesheets, it will look like a table)
```
gene_id, sample_1, sample_2,
gene_a, 12, 15,
gene_b, 13, 14
```

## Very General Sequencing Workflow

In the data type specific chapters, we will cover the sequencing data workflows and file formats in more detail. But in the most general sense, sequencing workflows look like this:

<div id="04D1599E33D92E370515664A58E78BE1EEB_69816"><div id="04D1599E33D92E370515664A58E78BE1EEB_69816_robot"><a href="https://cloud.smartdraw.com/share.aspx/?pubDocShare=04D1599E33D92E370515664A58E78BE1EEB" target="_blank"><img src="https://cloud.smartdraw.com/cloudstorage/04D1599E33D92E370515664A58E78BE1EEB/preview2.png"></a></div></div><script src="https://cloud.smartdraw.com/plugins/html/js/sdjswidget_html.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">SDJS_Widget("04D1599E33D92E370515664A58E78BE1EEB",69816,1,"");</script><br/>

### Sequencing file formats

#### SAM - Sequence Alignment Map
SAM Files are text based files that have sequence information. It generally has not bee quantified or mapped. It is the reads in their raw form. [For more about SAM files](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf).

#### BAM - Binary Alignment Map
BAM files are like SAM files but are compressed (made to take up less space on your computer). This means if you double click on a BAM file to look at it, it will look jumbled and unintelligible. You will need to convert it to a SAM file if you want to see it yourself (but this isn't necessary necessarily).

#### SAI/BAI - Binary Alignment Index

#### FASTA - "fast A"

Fasta files are sequence files that can be either nucleotide or amino acid sequences. They look something like this (the example below illustrating an amino acid sequence):

```
>SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
```

For [more about fasta files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format).

#### FASTQ - "Fast q"

A Fastq file is like a Fasta file except that it also contains information about the **Q**uality of the read. By quality, we mean, how sure was the sequencing machine that the nucleotide or amino acid called was indeed called correctly?

```
@SEQ_ID
GATTTGGGGTTCAAAGCAGTATCGATCAAATAGTAAATCCATTTGTTCAACTCACAGTTT
+
!''*((((***+))%%%++)(%%%%).1***-+*''))**55CCF>>>>>>CCCCCCC65
```

For [more about fastq files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTQ_format).

Later in this course we will discuss the importance of examining the quality of your sequencing data and how to do that. If you received your data from a bioinformatics core it is possible that they've already done this quality analysis for you.

_Sequencing data that is not of high enough quality should not be trusted!_ It may need to be re-run entirely or may need extra processing (trimming) in order to make it more trustworthy. We will discuss this more in later chapters.

#### BCL - binary base call (BCL) sequence file format

This type of sequence file is specific to Illumina data. In most cases, you will simply want to convert it to Fastq files for use with non-Illumina programs.

[More about BCL to Fastq conversion](https://medium.com/@marija190396/bcl-to-fastq-conversion-e289852823d0).

#### VCF - Variant Call Format

VCF files are further processed form of data than the sequence files we discussed above. VCF files are specially for storing only where a particular sample's sequences differ or are _variant_ from the reference genome or each other.

This will only be pertinent to you if you care about DNA variants. We will discuss this in the DNA seq chapter.

For [more on VCF files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_Call_Format).

#### MAF - Mutation Annotation Format

MAF files are aggregated versions of VCF files. So for a group of samples for which each has a VCF file, your entire group of samples' variants will be summarized in the form of a MAF file.

For [more on MAF files](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Data/File_Formats/MAF_Format/#:~:text=Mutation%20Annotation%20Format%20(MAF)%20is,(or%20open%2Daccess).).

## Very General Microarray Workflow

In the data type specific chapters, we will cover the microarray workflow and file formats in more detail. But in the most general sense, microarray workflows look like this, note that the exact file formats are specific to the chip brand and type you use (e.g. Illumina, Affymetrix, Agilent, etc.):

<div id="CB1322FC70C4A4B3A1BF2D8AC29A7E9FFF8_81516"><div id="CB1322FC70C4A4B3A1BF2D8AC29A7E9FFF8_81516_robot"><a href="https://cloud.smartdraw.com/share.aspx/?pubDocShare=CB1322FC70C4A4B3A1BF2D8AC29A7E9FFF8" target="_blank"><img src="https://cloud.smartdraw.com/cloudstorage/CB1322FC70C4A4B3A1BF2D8AC29A7E9FFF8/preview2.png"></a></div></div><script src="https://cloud.smartdraw.com/plugins/html/js/sdjswidget_html.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">SDJS_Widget("CB1322FC70C4A4B3A1BF2D8AC29A7E9FFF8",81516,1,"");</script><br/>

#### CEL

#### EXP

## General informatics files

At various points in your genomics workflows, you may need to use other types of files to help you annotate your data. We'll also discuss some of these common files that you may encounter:

#### BED
#### GTF
#### GFF
#### BED
