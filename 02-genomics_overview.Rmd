# A Very General Genomics Overview

## Learning Objectives

```{r, fig.alt = "Learning objectives This chapter will demonstrate how to: Understand what will be covered in this course. Find information about your particular file format", echo = FALSE}

```

In this chapter we are going to cover sequencing and microarray workflows at a very general high level overview to give you a first orientation. As we dive into specific data types and experiments, we will get into more specifics.
Here we will cover the most common file formats. If you have a file format you are dealing with that you don't see listed here, it may be specific to your data type and we will discuss that more in that data type's respective chapter. We still suggest you go through this chapter to give you a basic understanding of commonalities of all genomic data types and workflows

### What do genomics workflows look like?

In the most general sense, all genomics data when originally collected is raw, it needs to undergo processing to be normalized and ready to use. Then normalized data is generally summarized in a way that is ready for it to be further consumed. Lastly this summarized data is what can be used to make inferences and create plots and results tables.

### Basic file formats

Before we get into bioinformatic file types, we should establish some general file types that you likely have already worked with on your computer. These file types are used in all kinds of applications and not specific to bioinformatics.

#### TSV - Tab Separated Values

#### CSV - Comma Separated Values

#### TXT - Text

## Very General Sequencing Workflow

In the data type specific chapters, we will cover the data file formats in more detail. But in the most general sense, sequencing workflows look like this:

<div id="04D1599E33D92E370515664A58E78BE1EEB_69816"><div id="04D1599E33D92E370515664A58E78BE1EEB_69816_robot"><a href="https://cloud.smartdraw.com/share.aspx/?pubDocShare=04D1599E33D92E370515664A58E78BE1EEB" target="_blank"><img src="https://cloud.smartdraw.com/cloudstorage/04D1599E33D92E370515664A58E78BE1EEB/preview2.png"></a></div></div><script src="https://cloud.smartdraw.com/plugins/html/js/sdjswidget_html.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">SDJS_Widget("04D1599E33D92E370515664A58E78BE1EEB",69816,1,"");</script><br/>

### Sequencing file formats
