# A Very General Genomics Overview

## Learning Objectives

```

In this chapter we are going to cover sequencing and microarray workflows at a very general high level overview to give you a first orientation. As we dive into specific data types and experiments, we will get into more specifics.
Here we will cover the most common file formats. If you have a file format you are dealing with that you don't see listed here, it may be specific to your data type and we will discuss that more in that data type's respective chapter. We still suggest you go through this chapter to give you a basic understanding of commonalities of all genomic data types and workflows

### What do genomics workflows look like?

In the most general sense, all genomics data when originally collected is raw, it needs to undergo processing to be normalized and ready to use. Then normalized data is generally summarized in a way that is ready for it to be further consumed. Lastly, this summarized data is what can be used to make inferences and create plots and results tables.

### Basic file formats

Before we get into bioinformatic file types, we should establish some general file types that you likely have already worked with on your computer. These file types are used in all kinds of applications and not specific to bioinformatics.

#### TXT - Text

A text file is a very basic file format that contains text!

#### TSV - Tab Separated Values

Tab separated values file is a text file is good for storing a data table.
It has rows and columns where each value is separated by (you guessed it), _tabs_.
Most commonly, if your genomics data has been provided to you in a TSV or CSV file, it has been processed and summarized! It will be your job to know _how_ it was processed and summarized

```
gene_id &#9;sample_1 &#9;sample_2,
gene_a &#9; 12 &#9; 15,
gene_b &#9; 13 &#9; 14
```

#### CSV - Comma Separated Values

A comma separated values file is list just like a TSV file but instead of values being separated by tabs it is separated by... (you guessed it), _commas_!

In its raw form, a CSV file might look like our example below (but if you open it with a program for spreadsheets, like Excel or Googlesheets, it will look like a table)
```
gene_id, sample_1, sample_2,
gene_a, 12, 15,
gene_b, 13, 14
```

## Very General Sequencing Workflow

In the data type specific chapters, we will cover the sequencing data workflows and file formats in more detail. But in the most general sense, sequencing workflows look like this:

<div id="04D1599E33D92E370515664A58E78BE1EEB_69816"><div id="04D1599E33D92E370515664A58E78BE1EEB_69816_robot"><a href="https://cloud.smartdraw.com/share.aspx/?pubDocShare=04D1599E33D92E370515664A58E78BE1EEB" target="_blank"><img src="https://cloud.smartdraw.com/cloudstorage/04D1599E33D92E370515664A58E78BE1EEB/preview2.png"></a></div></div><script src="https://cloud.smartdraw.com/plugins/html/js/sdjswidget_html.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">SDJS_Widget("04D1599E33D92E370515664A58E78BE1EEB",69816,1,"");</script><br/>

### Sequencing file formats

#### SAM - Sequence Alignment Map
SAM Files have sequence information https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf

#### BAM - Binary Alignment Map

#### BAI - Binary Alignment Index

#### Fasta -

#### Fastq

#### VCF -

#### MAF

#### BCL

## Very General Microarray Workflow

In the data type specific chapters, we will cover the microarray workflow and file formats in more detail. But in the most general sense, microarray workflows look like this, note that the exact file formats are specific to the chip brand and type you use (e.g. Illumina, Affymetrix, Agilent, etc.):

<div id="CB1322FC70C4A4B3A1BF2D8AC29A7E9FFF8_81516"><div id="CB1322FC70C4A4B3A1BF2D8AC29A7E9FFF8_81516_robot"><a href="https://cloud.smartdraw.com/share.aspx/?pubDocShare=CB1322FC70C4A4B3A1BF2D8AC29A7E9FFF8" target="_blank"><img src="https://cloud.smartdraw.com/cloudstorage/CB1322FC70C4A4B3A1BF2D8AC29A7E9FFF8/preview2.png"></a></div></div><script src="https://cloud.smartdraw.com/plugins/html/js/sdjswidget_html.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">SDJS_Widget("CB1322FC70C4A4B3A1BF2D8AC29A7E9FFF8",81516,1,"");</script><br/>

### Microarray file formats

#### IDAT or DAT
#### CEL
https://www.affymetrix.com/support/developer/powertools/changelog/gcos-agcc/cel.html
#### CHP
#### EXP

## General informatics files

At various points in your genomics workflows, you may need to use other types of files to help you annotate your data. We'll also discuss some of these common files that you may encounter:

#### BED
#### GTF
#### GFF
#### BED

\* If you didn't see a file type listed you are looking for, take a look at this [list by the BROAD](https://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/gsea/wiki/index.php/Data_formats). OR it may be covered in the data type specific chapters.
